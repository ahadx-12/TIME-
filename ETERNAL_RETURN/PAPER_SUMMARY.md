# ETERNAL_RETURN – Simulation Summary

- For ω = 0.5, we detected a critical radius **r_crit ≈ 1.414**, where φ-loops transition to timelike paths.
- Below r_crit, light cones remain mostly upright (causal region).
- Beyond r_crit, closed φ-loops become timelike, signaling the CTC region.

- Monte Carlo with `noise_level = 0.5` and 300 iterations:
  - At low complexity (1 → 5), survival_rate falls from **0.4700** (complexity 1) to **0.0333** (complexity 5).
  - At high complexity (≥ 200), survival_rate collapses to **0.0000**.

Interpretation:
- Geometry permits time loops once the critical radius is crossed.
- Information-theoretic self-consistency is harsh: increasing entropy rapidly suppresses the eternal return, driving survival probability to zero at high complexity.
